abstract = {An original method has been developed to model geology using the location of the geological interfaces and orientation data from structural field. Both types of data are cokriged to interpolate a continuous 3D potential-field scalar function describing the geometry of the geology. Geology contact locations set the position of reference isovalues while orientation data are the gradients of the scalar function. Geometry of geological bodies is achieved by discretising reference isovalues. Faults are modelled using the same method by inserting discontinuities in the potential field. Potential fields can be combined to model realistic, complex geometry: scalar functions representing separate geological series are merged automatically using geological rules to enable fast computation and easy update of interpretation. The methodology has been applied to a wide range of geological contexts including orogenic domains, basins, intrusive and extrusive environments.}
